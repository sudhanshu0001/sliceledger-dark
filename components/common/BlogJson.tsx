As the number of users increases, Layer 1 starts crumbling. Slow processing speed, slow confirmation and transaction time and slow throughput are all the shortcomings of Layer 1 Blockchain protocols.</p><h3 class="h3-title">Introducing Layer 2 - How will it scale blockchain networks?</h3><p>The fundamental logic behind developing a Layer 2 protocol is that the blockchain industry is experiencing enormous growth and promise. Layer-2 solutions are secondary frameworks built on top of an existing blockchain ecosystem.

        jsonData: `<p>Blockchain technology has completely changed the way we do business.</p><p>The majority, if not all, of organizations, might see their productivity and profitability grow due to the incorporation of blockchain.</p><p>Companies nowadays must be adaptable, responsive, and innovative to survive. Taking the example of Supply Chain, the businesses that thrive are the ones that foster constant innovation across their Supply-Chain, and who stand out in a fiercely competitive market by continuing to be agile and pertinent. Fortunately, blockchain technology can facilitate process simplification.</p><h4>What is Supply Chain?</h4><p>A supply chain is the network of all the people, businesses, resources, tasks, and technological advancements involved in the manufacturing and distribution of a good. An entire supply chain, from the distribution of raw materials to the supplier and manufacturer to the final delivery to the customer, is included. A company builds a network of suppliers (or "links" in the chain") to transfer the product from raw material suppliers to organizations that deal with customers directly.</p><h4>How are the organizations linked in Supply Chain?</h4><p>The organizations in Supply Chain are linked through the physical and information flow of goods and services.</p><ol><li>Physical flow involves the movement and storage of raw materials and goods.</li><li>The information flow involves the interaction between parties involved in the chain to manage the day-to-day flow of goods and raw materials.</li></ol><h4>Challenges faced by Supply Chain Sector</h4><ol><li><b> Lack of Transparency </b>- This happens because organizations involved in the supply chain are still keeping their database confined to themselves. It has resulted in a communication gap within the chain because the database is shared if someone requests it.</li><li><b>Inadequate Traceability </b>- The inability to trace the products has become a severe problem for this sector. It makes it simpler for exploiters to replace "lookalike" fake goods with genuine articles.</li><li><b> Increased Costs</b> - Every team builds and maintains its own database, so they frequently invest time and money acquiring the same data repeatedly. The accompanying cost will significantly increase as a result.</li><li><b> Prolonged Quality Analysis </b>- Accurately identifying the moment at which quality is compromised is time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, a centralized structure exposes a company's processes to several dangers like fraud and code of conduct violations, emphasizing the critical need for robust risk management procedures in supply chain systems.</li></ol><h4>Blockchain as a Solution for Supply Chain</h4><p>Blockchain will allow companies to track all transactions more securely and transparently. It supports consensus, therefore there will be no disagreement over the transactions in the chain. Since every participant in the chain has access to the same version of the ledger, it has the unique ability to track ownership data. It will also help organizations trace the product from its source point to its end consumption. Every time the product/goods undergo a specific process, it will be documented. This documentation will reduce time delays, costs and human inefficiencies. Blockchain will also enhance the licensing process of services, goods and software.</p><h4>Summing Up</h4><p>Supply networks are becoming more intricate and challenging to maintain. There are issues because separate computer systems inside a company may not integrate, or different computer systems used by participants in a supply chain may not integrate. Blockchain Technology will help in addressing issues of complex supply chains. The use of blockchain network protocols will boost productivity, improve supply chain visibility, and finally stop errors and fraud.</p></div>`

        title: "The List of Best Blockchain Protocols in Dubai",
        slug: "best-blockchain-protocols-in-dubai",
        img: blog6,
        jsonData: `<p>The popularity and growth witnessed in the blockchain sector resulted in the development of several blockchain protocols. Every protocol is unique. While one can handle the issue of network congestion, others can offer interoperability and scalability. </p><p>So, which protocol can be considered the best?</p><p>Below are discussed some features of blockchain protocols that can make your choice easier.</p><ol><li><b> Decentralized</b> -Decentralization is the most important aspect of any blockchain protocol. It can be called the backbone of blockchain technology. Because of decentralization, no single governing body has the power of making all the choices. For every node in the blockchain network, the ledger is the same. The blockchain network's decentralization nature offers several benefits.</li><li> <b> Immutable </b>-Blockchain Protocols are immutable .i.e data of all the transactions is permanent. The records that have been validated cannot be altered. As a result, no user on the network will be able to modify, alter, or remove the records.</li><li> <b> Consensus </b>-These days blockchain protocols use different mechanisms to reach a consensus. Consensus is a decision-making technique that helps the active nodes come to a consensus and ensures that the system runs smoothly. Although nodes might not have much confidence in one another, they can have confidence in the network's central algorithm.</li><li> <b> Faster Transaction Settlements </b>-In comparison to conventional financial systems, blockchain provides a faster transaction settlement. This blockchain function makes life simpler. Without any intermediary, the transactional speed and efficiency have increased due to this technology.</li><li> <b> Security </b>-All the records are encrypted in the network. This increases the security factor of the network. Additionally, every blockchain is hashed cryptographically in the network. Each block, therefore, has a unique identity. All the hash ids need to be changed if there is any attempt to modify the data.</li></ol><h4>The Top 3 Best Blockchain Protocols in Dubai</h4><p>Based on the above features, here is the list of the best blockchain protocols in Dubai.</p><ol><li> <b> SliceLedger </b>-SliceLedger is a Layer-2 blockchain protocol. It is EVM-compatible and supports around 1,00,000 transactions per second. It uses Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Play consensus mechanisms. SliceLedger can be used for the development of decentralized applications. The transaction fees are almost negligible which makes it developer and user-friendly. It is an interoperable and scalable blockchain. One of the most distinctive features of SliceLedger is that it can be used to increase trust, transparency and traceability in the enterprise sector.</li><li> <b> Mina Protocol </b>-Mina Protocol is the world's lightest blockchain protocol. It aims to overcome the issue of blockchain size. It incorporates zk-SNARKS which stands for "zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge". The native cryptocurrency of this blockchain network protocol is MINA which is used to facilitate network transactions and distribute fees between the users.</li><li> <b> Polygon</b>-Polygon is the scaling solution of Ethereum. It is built to address the scalability issues of Ethereum. Polygon handles transactions on separate Ethereum-compatible blockchains. Polygon sends transactions back to the main Ethereum network after post-processing. Thus, the Ethereum network's load is reduced by this strategy. By doing this, Polygon accelerates transactions. It also helps in cutting transaction costs.</li></ol><h4>Summing Up</h4><p>Blockchain technology is continually evolving. New blockchain network protocols will keep coming into the market with the latest and additional features. However, the choice of blockchain protocol will remain one of the most vital considerations even in the future. The infrastructure and operating principles of blockchain protocols should therefore be customized to match the changing development needs of this expanding community. Although protocols have a lot of potential for improving user experience, the first thing they need to do is focus on being much more developer-friendly.</p>`
